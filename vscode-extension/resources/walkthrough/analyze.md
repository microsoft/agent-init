## Discover Your Repository

AgentRC scans your codebase to detect **languages**, **frameworks**, **package managers**, and **monorepo structure**.

This analysis powers everything else — instructions are tailored to your stack, readiness checks know what to look for, and configs match your tooling.

### What gets detected

- Programming languages and their relative usage
- Frameworks (React, Express, Django, Spring, etc.)
- Monorepo workspaces (npm, pnpm, Cargo, Go, .NET, and more)
- Logical areas like frontend, backend, and infrastructure

### Try it

Click the button below, or use `AgentRC: Analyze Repository` from the Command Palette.

The results appear in the **AgentRC** sidebar — expand each category to explore.
